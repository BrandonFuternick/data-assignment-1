      <img src="images/closed.png" alt='closed' <p class="icon-text"> When COVID-19 hit the U.S. in March of this year, live entertainment venues were the first businesses forced to shut down completely. With no revenue in over half a year and no
      clear end in sight, these
      venues
      their employees are struggling to make ends meet until they can reopen.</p>

      <img src="images/money.png" alt='money' <p> According to the National Independent Venue Association (NIVA), the live music industry produces upwards of $20 billion in annual revenue a year. On top of their own revenue, these venues attract
      business to bars, hotels, restaurants, and shops in their local areas. </p>

      <img src="images/congress.png" alt='congress' <p> The 'Save our Stages Act' was introduced in the Senate in July by Senators John Cornyn (TX) and Amy Klobuchar (MN). If enacted, the bill would provide up to $12 million in grants to any
      individual
      "eligible
      live venue operator, promoter, producer, or talent representative" that is affected by the shutdown. The Senate has been on several recesses since the bill was introduced and failed to even hold a vote on it. </p>

      <img src="images/press.png" alt='press' <p> Senator Chuck Schumer (NY) has been an outspoken proponent of the 'Save Our Stages Act', holding press conferences with prominent performers such as comedian
      Jerry Seinfeld and musician James Murphy. A country-wide stunt called #RedAlert was held last month, which featured hundreds of impacted venues turning their marquees red to create a
      real-life map showing the widespread effect of the pandemic closures. </p>
